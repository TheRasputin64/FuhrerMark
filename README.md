## what it does
* frontend language that compiles to HTML (because why not)
* uses `.fm` files (fancy, right?)
* minimalistic syntax for minimalistic souls

## example
```
HelloVoid {
    text: why are we here
    color: #void
    font-size: 42
    text: just to compile
    color: #darkness
    font-size: 13
}
```

## known issues
- everything
- probably breaks
- documentation? what documentation?
- your hopes and dreams

## installation
1. clone (if you must)
2. npm i (goodbye RAM)
3. regret
